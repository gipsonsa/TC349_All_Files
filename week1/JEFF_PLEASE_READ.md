Hello Jeff,

I know I said this in the email but I was having a lot of difficulties with git and I actually 
had my assignment turned in on time, with a little trouble on the gitHub pages for hosting my 
website. I just wanted to give you the heads up so that you didn't think I was turning in a late 
assignment. The original repository I am not using for some issues so I moved my files to another 
one. Just thought I should let you know.

P.S. My website is hosted on http://gipsonsa.github.io/tc349_LOTS_OF_PROBLEMS
which is my other repository I have on this website.

Thanks,

Samuel Gipson
